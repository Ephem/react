<!--
  Lightyear is a fork of React. Issues not relating to the extended functionality should be filed in the React repository instead of here.

  If you are uncertain of where to post an issue:

  * If related to Suspense functionality, file an issue here in the Lightyear repository
  * If not related to Suspense:
    * Try to create a reproduction case without any Suspense
    * Try running `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` instead of Lightyear
    * If the above worked, file an issue here in Lightyear
    * If `renderToString` did not work, file issue in the React repository
